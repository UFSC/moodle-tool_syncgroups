Copy groups between courses Plugin for Moodle
---------------------------------------------------

With this plugin you can synchronize groups and groups members between two courses,
in a way that a course A will be a mirror of course B.

By default, only users that are already enrolled are added as group members,
but you can choose to also enrol users that are not already enrolled.
